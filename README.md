dejavu
======

dejavu is a utility module for Drupal 7.
Often while developing in drupal 7, you will discover you are doing a lot of copy paste for some of the very obvious features and 
you will have a hard time to find the code you were looking for. This module is the collection of those little code snippets which
you can use in all of your projects and you will get used to these function names like you get used to the drupal built in functions
and hooks.
